          Hello, everyone âœ‹
          <p>
            <Text as p className={classes.strike}>
              I'm a software developer living in Bangalore, India. I love to
              build and design things. I have experience in creating
              cross-platform desktop applications, website backends, user
              experience, and visual design. I have worked extensively in teams
              and alone.

            <p>WTF? Sound human Koushith. Okay, here you go.</p> Huh, so you're
            interested in knowing more about me? The first thing I should
            mention that I don't have any unique talents. I consider myself
            pretty average. My two life principles are - don't give up and work
            really hard in the right direction. That's how I have achieved
            whatever you see so far. Born in a small town in Kodagu known as
            (Coorg- Scotland of India), I have humble beginnings. Until 2016,
            the only thing I knew about computers was that it was invented by a
            guy named Charles or something..From there, I have taught myself
            everything. I'm still learning. I still have to Google the basic
            stuff like adding inline CSS in HTML :p.
