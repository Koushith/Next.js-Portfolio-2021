# Portex
Secure crypto portfolio management and exchange application

## About
Most of the existing management tools are managed by services that don't guarantee complete confidentiality. Even the portfolio tools that guarantee don't have a mechanism to exchange and share it with other users in a secure manner.
We feel that it can be solved with the help of a user-controlled profile (Decentralized Identities) and an open yet secure way of exchanging messages.
The solution we built using Portex provides a way for each user to maintain their portfolio confidentially. It also gives flexibility for the user to exchange their portfolio securely whenever there is a need to share such information with other users or institutions without exposing it to any intermediaries.
