          I'm a software developer living in Bangalore, India. I love to build
          and design things. I have experience in creating cross-platform
          desktop applications, website backends, user experience, and visual
          design. I have worked extensively in teams and alone.

          WTF? Sound human Koushith. Okay, here you go. Huh, so you're
          interested in knowing more about me? The first thing I should mention
          that I don't have any unique talents. I consider myself pretty
          average.
        </p>

          <b>My two life principles are -</b>

          <ul>
            <li> Don't give up.</li>
            <li>Work really hard in the right direction.</li>
          </ul>

          That's how I have achieved whatever you see so far. Born in a small
          Village in Kodagu also known as (Coorg- Scotland of India), I have
          humble beginnings. Until 2016, the only thing I knew about computers
          was that it was invented by a guy named Charles or something..From
          there, I have taught myself everything. I'm still learning. I still
          have to Google the basic stuff like adding inline CSS in HTML :p.
